Deepfake Detection usin Deep Learining

The rapid advancement in computational power has facilitated the creation of indistin-
guishable human-synthesized videos, known as deep fakes, which pose serious risks such
as political manipulation, fake terrorism incidents, and privacy violations. In response,
this project introduces a novel deep learning-based approach to effectively distinguish
AI-generated fake videos from authentic ones. Our method specializes in detecting re-
placement and reenactment deep fakes, leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) to combat AI-generated threats. We employ a Res-Next Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) to extract frame-level features, which are then utilized to train a Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classification. To
ensure real-world applicability, our system undergoes rigorous evaluation on large, di-
verse datasets combining sources like Face-Forensic++, Deepfake Detection Challenge,
and Celeb-DF. By adopting a straightforward yet robust approach, we demonstrate com-
petitive performance in real-time scenarios, highlighting the efficacy of our deep learning
model in detecting and mitigating the risks posed by deep fake videos.
